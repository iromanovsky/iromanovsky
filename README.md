### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My job is to help customers on their journey to adopt cloud infra solutions by translating business requirements into reliable, scalable, and secure solutions, in the stages from pre-selling to implementation on a worldwide enterprise scale. My current specialization is Core Infrastructure on Azure Cloud, and I have rich experience in implementing international flagship projects in this area, in the roles of lead consultant/systems architect.
